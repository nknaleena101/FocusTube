ðŸš€ FocusTube
FocusTube is a minimalist Chrome extension built to help you reclaim your focus and fight the endless rabbit hole of YouTube distractions.

When activated, FocusTube hides all video recommendations from the YouTube home screen â€” no more flashy thumbnails begging for your attention. You keep full access to the search bar, sidebar, and navigation, so you can still watch the videos you actually came for â€” without getting ambushed by irrelevant suggestions.
