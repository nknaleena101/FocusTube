# 🚀 FocusTube

> A minimalist Chrome extension to help you reclaim your focus and stop falling down the YouTube rabbit hole.

---

## ✨ Overview

FocusTube hides all video recommendations from the YouTube home screen — no more flashy thumbnails competing for your attention.  
You keep full access to search, subscriptions, and the sidebar, so you can watch exactly what you came for — **without getting ambushed by irrelevant suggestions**.

---

## 🎯 Why FocusTube?

Let’s be real: YouTube’s home feed is a productivity killer.  
One "quick" video easily turns into an hour of mindless scrolling.  

**FocusTube tackles this head-on**, empowering you to use YouTube intentionally, without the mental clutter.

## 💡 Features

- 🛡️ **Hide home feed:** Removes the entire home video grid.
- 🔎 **Keep core features:** Search, subscriptions, and navigation all stay fully functional.
- ⚡ **Lightweight & fast:** Zero bloat, minimal footprint.
- ✅ **Simple toggle control:** Optional popup UI for quick enable/disable.

## 🛠️ How It Works

FocusTube injects a content script into YouTube pages that automatically removes video feed elements.  
It uses a `MutationObserver` to continuously monitor and block new elements — even when navigating within YouTube’s single-page app (SPA) architecture.
