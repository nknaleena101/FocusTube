When FocusTube is turned on, your YouTube home feed is wiped clean — no distracting recommended videos, no endless scroll traps. You can still use the search bar, browse your subscriptions, **so you can still search and watch any videos you actually came for** — Stay focused, stay in control.

## 🎯 Why FocusTube?

Let’s be real: YouTube’s home feed is a productivity killer.  
One "quick" video easily turns into an hour of mindless scrolling.  

**FocusTube tackles this head-on**, empowering you to use YouTube intentionally, without the mental clutter.

## 💡 Features

- 🛡️ **Hide home feed:** Removes the entire home video grid.
- 🔎 **Keep core features:** Search, subscriptions, and navigation all stay fully functional.
- ⚡ **Lightweight & fast:** Zero bloat, minimal footprint.
- ✅ **Simple toggle control:** Optional popup UI for quick enable/disable.

## 🛠️ How It Works

FocusTube injects a content script into YouTube pages that automatically removes video feed elements.  
It uses a `MutationObserver` to continuously monitor and block new elements — even when navigating within YouTube’s single-page app (SPA) architecture.
